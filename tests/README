To run the tests:

1. Navigate to the base directory of your project. This directory should contain the source files

2. From that directory, execute the runtests executable in this directory
  Like:  ~cs537-1/tests/P7/start.py

This will create a directory named "mnt" and mount your filesystem onto it.
